The Board would like to thank Okomboli Ong’ang’a for his service on the Board.

Two key goals for the year:
* Thinking through the merit scholarship component of thel fund and how to implement it. The model originally envisioned by the founders was based on their US experience and now is a good time to review the model.
* Encouraging Alumni contribution. How to keep alumni engaged and committed to supporting the fund.
