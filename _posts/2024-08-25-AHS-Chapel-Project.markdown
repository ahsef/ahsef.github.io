# Background
The AHS Old Boys Club has pledged to fund more than half of the "AHS Chapel Project" - the construction of a multi-purpose hall to host events and programs that enrich
student life.

AHSEF has offered to facilitate the collection of funds from old boys and other supporters in the US who would like to contribute to the project.

# Initiating the framework
Based on solid pledges from old boys in the US to raise an initial amount of $3,000, a Vanguard account will be created specifically for collecting and
disbursing US-based old boy donations for the Chapel Project.

Initial funds can be collected towards the $3,000 Vanguard account using the paypal link below.

# Investment policy

Funds will be invested in a money market fund at AHSEF's current investment service provider, Vanguard.

# Disbursement of funds

Every quarter, any funds above the account maintenance threshold of $3,000 will be sent to the AHS Endowment Fund Trust in Kenya, which will
administer disbursement to the project. A minimum amount of $1,000 will be sent at any one time to minimize the impact of transaction costs.

# Promotion and fundraising

These activities will remain within the ambit of the OBC, and other Chapel Project committees. AHSEF will limit its role to facilitating the collection,
disbursement, and reporting of funds.

# Account closure
On February 27 th 2026 â€“ by when the project is expected to be complete - AHSEF will shut down the account with a final disbursement of all residual funds to the
AHS Endowment Fund Trust in Kenya.
