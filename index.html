<article class="post index" role="article">
    <p>The Alliance High School Endowment Fund(AHSEF) is a US 501(3)(c) charitable organization that was founded to promote academic and overall student excellence at <a href="http://alliancehighschool.sc.ke/">Alliance High School, Kenya.</a></p>
   
    <p>AHSEF has four funds, the Academic Scholarship Fund, the Sports Directed Fund, the Need-based Scholarship Fund and the AHS Chapel Project Fund. The Academic Scholarship Fund awards scholarships to students based on academic merit. The Sports Directed Fund provides financial support for various team sports at Alliance High School in the spirit of encouraging students to excel in academics and sports. The Need-based fund was seeded by a generous Old Boy and awards scholarships to needy students. The AHS Chapel Fund was started to facilitate the collection of funds from old boys and other supporters in the US who would like to contribute to the construction of a multi-purpose hall to host events and programs that enrich student life.</p>
        
     <p>Since its founding, AHSEF has awarded over $35,000 in scholarships and has grown to over $160,000 in endowment funds.</p>
   
    <p>All gifts to AHSEF in the US are tax deductible and are eligible for employer matching. <a href="/donate" style="font-weight: bold;">Donate now</a></p>
